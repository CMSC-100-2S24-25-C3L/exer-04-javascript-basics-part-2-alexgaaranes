**Name**: Alexander Gabriel A. Aranes

**Section**: CMSC 100 C-3L

**Program Description**: The program is supposed run on `test.js` as it is the script that
calls the functions in the `index.js`. The main function of the program is to take input an array
containing user input credentials and use it for validation. If the credentials passed are valid,
it is saved in a `users.txt` file with its newly generated unique Id. The program makes use of two
`npm` packages namely, `uuid` and `validator`. `uuid` is used by a function in `index.js` that appends
a 8 character string id for the new user that passed the validations. One of the validations the credentials
must pass is the `isEmail` method of the `validator` package.

**Key Takeaways**: The different ways of importing are the main takeaway I have for this exercise. I managed to
properly test and practice the usage of CommonJS and ESModule that was used in this program. Another important thing
I learned while making the program is the usage of other modules made by the community. This makes the programmers
collaborate indirectly by providing their own works to help and contribute to the community.
